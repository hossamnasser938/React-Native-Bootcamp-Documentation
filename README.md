# React-Native-Bootcamp-Documentation
* This is my documentation for the free react-native bootcamp taught by 
[**Nader Dabit**](https://twitter.com/dabit3?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) who is a developer 
advocate at **Amazon** who is doing consultation in React Native for years.

* The Bootcamp resources(videos and repositories) can be found [here](https://tylermcginnis.com/free-react-native-bootcamp/).

* The Bootcamp walks you through the ` React Native ` development environment covering the hot topics in the framework:
  * Components, state, and props(React stuff).
  * Lifecycle hooks.
  * Native components and APIs such as ` CameraRoll `.
  * styling using FlexBox.
  * List Components especially ` FlatList ` component.
  * Animation using ` Animated ` API.
  * Navigation using ` react-navigation `.
  * Reaching the network using ` fetch ` API.
  * Authentication using ` AWS `.

* The bootcamp is divided among 3 days. I have documented a file for each day:
  * [Day 1](https://github.com/hossamnasser938/React-Native-Bootcamp-Documentation/blob/master/docs/day1.md).
  * [Day 2](https://github.com/hossamnasser938/React-Native-Bootcamp-Documentation/blob/master/docs/day2.md).
  * [Day 3](https://github.com/hossamnasser938/React-Native-Bootcamp-Documentation/blob/master/docs/day3.md).
 
* This bootcamp is highly recommended for beginners and intermediate-level developers.
